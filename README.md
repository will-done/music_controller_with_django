# Music Controller with Django ðŸŽ¶

This project is a web application designed not only for listening to music but also for **managing it collaboratively**. 
With Spotify API integration, users can play, pause, skip forward/backward, and control playlists.  

The core idea of the application is to allow multiple people in the same environment to have control over the music. 
For example, at a house party or a casual gathering, everyone can decide the next track, and through a voting system, 
the flow of music progresses democratically. In this way, music becomes not just an individual activity but a **shared experience**.

## Purpose

- Enable users to create **shared playlists** in the same environment  
- Provide a **reliable API** powered by Djangoâ€™s robust backend  
- Deliver a **user-friendly interface** with modern web technologies  

---

## Rooms and Code System

In the project, each user can create a **private room** and invite others:  
- When a room is created, the system automatically generates a **room code**.  
- Other users can join the same room by entering this code.  
- Everyone inside the room can control the music (e.g., pause, skip, change the playlist).  
- This ensures a **synchronized music experience** across different usersâ€™ devices.  

Thanks to this feature, the project is not just an individual music controller but also a **shared music platform for groups of friends**.

## About the Project

- The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework.  
- Spotify API integration enables real-time music control.  
- The room system allows users to connect through unique codes and listen to the same music together.  
- The project was developed as part of a learning and practice process, aiming to strengthen both Django skills and understanding of API integration.

## Highlights

- **Real-time control**: Play, pause, skip forward/backward  
- **Collaborative experience**: Multiple users sharing control over the same music  
- **Room code system**: Users join the same music session with unique codes  
- **Educational value**: Practicing Django REST API development, Spotify API integration, and frontend-backend interaction

This project is built on the idea of turning music from an individual preference into a **shared experience**. It can be used both as a fun application and as a practical example for those learning Django.
